# matrix

[MatrixJS](https://github.com/kennytilton/MatrixJS) for ClojureScript.

## Overview

Matrix combines ClojureScript, a thin HTML generator, and the CLJS version of Cells to produce a simple but powerful and efficient CLJS Web/mobile development framework. A sister project of the pure JS [js/matrixjs](https://github.com/kennytilton/MatrixJS/tree/master/js/matrixjs) framework.

## Setup 

This project was created from David Nolen's excellent [mies template](https://github.com/swannodette/mies). Here we reproduce the critical elements of the setup instructions from that template:

> Most of the following scripts require [rlwrap](http://utopia.knoware.nl/~hlub/uck/rlwrap/) (on OS X installable via brew).
>
> Build your project once in dev mode with the following script and then open `index.html` in your browser.
>
>    ./scripts/build
>
> To auto build your project in dev mode:
>
>    ./scripts/watch

Now just open matrix/index.html in Chrome or Safari on Mac OS X. (Not saying it will not work elsehwere, butwe do know FireFox seems to want this Babel-ized. We'll get to that shortly.)
