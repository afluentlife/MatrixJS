# MatrixJS TodoMVC

Welcome to the MatrixJS implementation of TodoMVC, a do-list app [specified here](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/master/app-spec.md) by the good folks at [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com). 

For now, this is also the official version of the JS version of MatrixJS. Once stable we will find a nice CDN home for it.

A walkthrough of the TodoMVC code is our next task. For now, there is just [an overview](https://github.com/kennytilton/MatrixJS) and a heavily [annotated version](https://github.com/kennytilton/MatrixJS/blob/master/js/matrixjs/js/app-annotated.js) of the TodoMVC implementation.
